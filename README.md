# Readable Frontend

This is the readable frontend project for the final assessment for Udacity's Redux course which consists of a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This needs to be run along with readable backend API server which is present in another repository at https://github.com/surenderboora/reactnd-project-readable-starter.

## Start Developing

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - Read instruction [here](https://github.com/surenderboora/reactnd-project-readable-starter/blob/master/README.md)
* In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    - `create-react-app readable`
    - `cd readable`
    - `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
